# Agentic AI Architecture

Reference architecture and best practices for building **scalable agentic AI systems** with RAG pipelines and LLM integrations.

---

## Overview
This repository provides blueprints and reference implementations for designing **agentic AI systems**. It focuses on:

- **RAG-based knowledge retrieval**  
- **LLM integration** (e.g., Ollama, LangChain)  
- **Scalable ML pipelines** and AI infrastructure  
- **Real-world AI solution deployment**

The goal is to help developers and architects build intelligent, robust, and production-ready AI systems.

---

## Key Components
1. **RAG Pipeline Examples** – Integration of retrieval mechanisms with LLMs.  
2. **Agentic AI Architecture Diagrams** – Visual guides to system design.  
3. **ML Pipeline Templates** – Data preprocessing, model training, and deployment pipelines.  
4. **Cloud & Deployment** – Guidelines for scaling with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
